      It was a good morning,
      waking up in my twin bed again. 
      There's this woman staring down at me like blessing, 
      red dress blond hair cacucasion or was it my imagination.
      
      Quickly pulled the covers over my face,
      realized she was just a snowflake.
      Mustered up the courage to look again but it was to late, 
      she disappears an leaves me heartaches, stargazed, headaches. 
      
     Lady there right by my bedside,
     this lonely lover boy. 
     Iint scared of you this time, 
     i'll put you on a pedestal but loving her made my mind so confused
     
     So confused. 
     So confused.
     Was this a good morning?

  <h2> Another hobbie of mine is <em>photography</em></h2>

<p> I took the two photos shown above. I picked these because they were chosen to be placed in a museum event back in 2019. </p>
  
  <h3> I like to play <em>chess</em> </h3>
  
<p>In my downtime, I like to play video games. However, with the amount of homework I've been dealing with, I haven't had the time or energy to do so. However, I will find the time to play a little bit of chess.</p> 
  
<p>The photo below is a screenshot I took of myself playing chess in a PC game called "VrChat". If you know what "VrChat" is my Username is Mrliteral so if you see me on the chess server don't be nervous to go a few chess rounds with me!</p>
