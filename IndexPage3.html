    <label><strong>I enjoy writing poems and then adding them to beats I find on YouTube. Below is a poem I wrote about a woman I met a long time ago:</strong></label>
      
    <!--"<input size="100" type="text" name="first_name_field">" The <input> tag creates a text input field where the user can type information.size="100": Sets the visible width of the input field to 100 characters. 
         
      type="text": Specifies that this is a text input field.
      
      name="first_name_field": Assigns a name to the input field, which is used when submitting form data (e.g., in a form, the value entered in this field would be sent as first_name_field).-->

      It was a good morning,
      waking up in my twin bed again. 
      There's this woman staring down at me like a blessing, 
      red dress, blond hair, Caucasianâ€”or was it my imagination?

      Quickly pulled the covers over my face,
      realized she was just a snowflake.
      Mustered up the courage to look again but it was too late, 
      she disappeared and left me heartaches, stargazed, headaches.

      Lady there right by my bedside,
      this lonely lover boy. 
      I ain't scared of you this time, 
      I'll put you on a pedestal, but loving her made my mind so confused.

      So confused. 
      So confused.
      So so,
      Was this a good morning?

<h2 id="box3">Another hobby of mine is photography</h2>

<p>I took the two photos shown above. I picked these because they were chosen to be displayed at a museum event back in 2019.</p>

<h3 id="box3">I like to play chess </h3>

<p>In my downtime, I like to play video games. However, with the amount of homework I've been dealing with, I haven't had the time or energy to do so. I hope to find some time to play a bit of chess soon.</p>

<p>The photo below is a screenshot I took of myself playing chess in a PC game called "VRChat". If you know what VRChat is, my username is Mrliteral, so if you see me on the chess server, don't be nervous to challenge me for a few rounds!</p>

<p>I'm a fan of watching anime as well. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poiut23/WebDev_ResumeSite/refs/heads/main/media/gif/35157.gif" alt="One of my favorite hand-to-hand combat animations from Naruto."> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poiut23/WebDev_ResumeSite/refs/heads/main/media/gif/tumblr_oejsc7l95x1rey868o1_500.gif" alt="I don't watch Dragon Ball Z much, but I enjoy their intense fights."></p>
