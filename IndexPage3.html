      It was a good morning,
      waking up in my twin bed again. 
      There's this woman staring down at me like blessing, 
      red dress blond hair cacucasion or was it my imagination.
      
      Quickly pulled the covers over my face,
      realized she was just a snowflake.
      Mustered up the courage to look again but it was to late, 
      she disappears an leaves me heartache, stargazed, headaches. 
      
     Lady there right by my bedside,
     this lonely lover boy. 
     Iint scared of you this time, 
     i'll put you on a pedestal but loving her made my mind so confused
     
     So confused. 
     So confused.
     Was this a good morning?
