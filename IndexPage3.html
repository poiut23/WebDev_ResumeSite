                It was a good morning,
                waking up in my twin bed again. 
                There's this woman staring down at me like a blessing, 
                red dress, blond hair, Caucasianâ€”or was it my imagination?
                
                Quickly pulled the covers over my face,
                realized she was just a snowflake.
                Mustered up the courage to look again but it was too late, 
                she disappeared and left me heartaches, stargazed, headaches.

                Lady there right by my bedside,
                this lonely lover boy. 
                I ain't scared of you this time, 
                I'll put you on a pedestal, but loving her made my mind so confused.

                So confused. 
                So confused.
                So so,
                Was this a good morning?

            <p>In my downtime, I like to play video games. However, with the amount of homework I've been dealing with, I haven't had the time or energy to do so. I hope to find some time to play a bit of chess soon.</p>
            <p>The photo below is a screenshot I took of myself playing chess in a PC game called "VRChat". If you know what VRChat is, my username is Mrliteral, so if you see me on the chess server, don't be nervous to challenge me for a few rounds!</p>
