      It was a good morning,
      waking up in my twin bed again. 
      There's this woman staring down at me like a blessing, 
      red dress, blond hair, Caucasianâ€”or was it my imagination?

      Quickly pulled the covers over my face,
      realized she was just a snowflake.
      Mustered up the courage to look again but it was too late, 
      she disappeared and left me heartaches, stargazed, headaches.

      Lady there right by my bedside,
      this lonely lover boy. 
      I ain't scared of you this time, 
      I'll put you on a pedestal, but loving her made my mind so confused.

      So confused. 
      So confused.
      So so,
      Was this a good morning?

<h3 id="p3t2">I like to play chess </h3>
<p>In my downtime, I like to play video games. However, with the amount of homework I've been dealing with, I haven't had the time or energy to do so. I hope to find some time to play a bit of chess soon.</p>

<p>The photo below is a screenshot I took of myself playing chess in a PC game called "VRChat". If you know what VRChat is, my username is Mrliteral, so if you see me on the chess server, don't be nervous to challenge me for a few rounds!</p>
